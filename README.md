# NIGHTBB61-Optimization-Consultant-for-FIA-Sustainable-Race-Calendar-Project-
This report presents a comprehensive analysis and optimization of the F1 (Formula 1) 2024 race calendar, aimed at minimizing the total travel distance and thereby reducing the carbon footprint associated with the logistical aspects of the season. Our findings reveal that the current scheduling results in extensive travel distances, contributing significantly to the sport's environmental impact. Through the application of mathematical modeling and geographical optimization, we propose a revised calendar that significantly reduces travel by 46.27% compared to the initial schedule and simultaneously satisfies the limitations with respect to sponsorship deals, contracts with tracks, and weather conditions. This reduction not only aligns with the FIA's sustainability goals set for 2030 but also presents an approach to address the criticisms related to the environmental impact of race scheduling.
